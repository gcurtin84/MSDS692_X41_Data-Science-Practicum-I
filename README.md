## Predicting Daily Fantasy Football Points Using Machine Learning

According to rotogrinders.com, the daily fantasy company Fanduel paid out more than $560 million in prizes during the 2014 calendar year.  With so much money to be made daily fantasy players are always looking for a tool that will give them an edge in selecting their daily fantasy teams.  As a daily fantasy football (DFF) ethusiast I have used many of the tools that promise better performance and winnings for DFF players.  All of those tools had one thing in common: they did not keep their promise.  The purpose of this project is to explore potential tools that can be used to gain that edge.

## Daily Fantasy Football

DFF is a simple concept.  A player selects a fantasy team from a pool of players that will play within a given timeframe.  In a traditional contest each player is assigned a salary.  The sum  of all player salaries must be less than the contest's budget.  For example, a Draftkings lineup requires that a DFF contestant selects on quarterback (QB), two running backs (RB), 3 wide recievers (WR), 1 tight end (TE), and the entire defense and special teams (DST) of one NFL franchise.  In addition the contestant gets to fill a flex position from either of the RB, WR or TE positions.  This makes a total of nine DFF positions. The contestant is given a budget of $50 thousand dollars and must pick players with combined salaries less than or equal to their budget.  Each position within the lineup accumulates points based on pre-defined rules.

#### QB Scoring Rules:
* Passing Touchdown (TD) = 4pts
* 25 Passing Yards = 1pt
* 300+ Yard Passing Game = 3pts
* Interception = -1pt

A contestant competes with the other players who have joined the same contest.  Which ever contestant has the highest scoring lineup wins the contest and the prize associated.  Most contests give a range of prizes to a certain percentage of the highest scoring contestants.  However simple this process may seem, the hard part is winning.  

## Personal Experience

From my own experience, I have found that one factor distinguishes if I win a prize.  Generally, when my overall score exceeds 180 total points, a prize is won.  Anything less than 180 points usually results in no prize.  With 9 DFF positions and a goal of 180 overall points, I attempt to pick players that will exceed 20 points.  Is it possible to make a tool that accurately predicts players that will exceed 20 fantasy points (FPTS)?  It is around this question that I have designed the tool described below.
